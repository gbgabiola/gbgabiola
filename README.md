I'm a Full-Stack Developer but currently more focus on Front-End Development.

### My Passion

My passion is user experience and creating real business value with a particular goal of understanding the human side of software development. In the words of [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me), "Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them... you have to study the people behind the software, too."

For personal things, I:

- love reading useful matierials like coding resources and docs.
- teach tech stuff to interesting people and career-shifters.
- love the tools related to react/gatsby and node.js.
- motivated to do Open-Source!
- am a traveler.
- only have one woman.
